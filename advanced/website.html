          <h1>What is this?</h1>

          <div class="content-block">

            <p>This is a private Minecraft server where the kids can play online
with their friends in a closed, safe, and moderated environment. Only players we
know are allowed to join at this time.</p>

            <p>This server is different from other Minecraft servers
because:</p>

            <ul>

              <li><strong>It is run by a parent:</strong><br> The server is
maintained by a parent who knows and plays Minecraft.</li>

              <li><strong>Nobody joins without permission:</strong><br> Players
must be approved to join the server, meaning every person your kid encounters is
somebody they already know from school.  There are no strangers.</li>

              <li><strong>There are rules:</strong><br> The admin takes a strong
position against griefing and bullying in the game. If it happens, <i>parents
will be notified</i>.  If it is really bad, the player may be temporarily or
permanently banned.</li>

            </ul>

            <p>The goal is to provide a place where kids can learn the basic
etiquette of online gaming, but in an environment that parents can trust. By
playing with friends they see daily, the kids will have a better understanding
of what online behavior is appropriate (and what is not).</p>

            <p>In other words, this server provides a tangible lesson that every
player in an online game is also a real person, with real emotions that are
affected by what they say and do - for better or worse.</p>

            <p>Scroll down for setup instructions, and learn how to request that
your player be added.</p>

          </div> <!-- .content-block -->

          <h1>Setup</h1>

          <div class="content-block">

            <p>To join the server you need to purchase and install <a
href="https://my.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft/#register">Minecraft Java
Edition</a> on a Mac or PC, and send your username to the admin.  Here's how you
do that:</p>

            <ol>

              <li><strong>Get a minecraft.net username:</strong><br> You will
need to create an account on <a
href="https://minecraft.net/en-us/login/?return_url=/profile">minecraft.net</a>
and pay for a license for Minecraft: Java Edition.  The license costs a one-time
fee of $26.95.</li>

              <li><strong>Download and install Minecraft Java
Edition:</strong><br> You will need to install this specific version of
Minecraft.  Minecraft Bedrock Edition (what you find on an iPad, Xbox, Switch,
and Windows 10) won't work, because it's a different game.  Instead, you need to
download and install <a
href="https://minecraft.net/en-us/download/alternative/">Minecraft: Java
Edition</a> for your computer.  It works with Windows, Mac, and Linux.</li>

              <li><strong>Log into Minecraft:</strong><br> When you start
Minecraft it will ask for a username and password.  You will use the same one
you just registered on minecraft.net to buy the license.</li>

              <li><strong>Send your username to the admin:</strong><br> The
admin needs to add your username to the list of allowed players.  Either email
it, or send it to school on a piece of paper.  All the admin needs is the
username (not the password), and a parent's email so he can send the final setup
instructions.</li>

            </ol>

          </div> <!-- .content-block -->

          <h1>Rules of the game</h1>

          <div class="content-block">

            <p>Each player must follow the rules of the server.</p>

            <ul>

              <li>Respect is everything.  Absolutely no bad language, trash
talk, or teasing.  This isn't ok in our home and it's not ok on this server.
The server keeps transcripts of players' chats with each other.  Players who do
this will be temporarily blocked, and their parents notified.  </li>

              <li>No griefing.  Griefing is anything intentionally done to
frustrate another player.  The goal is cooperative play.  Minecraft can be
frustrating, but it should be because of the difficulty of the game rather than
another player's actions.  Examples of griefing in Minecraft include:

                <ul>

                  <li>Stealing items from another player's chest.</li>

                  <li>Destroying another player's creations without their
permission.</li>

                  <li>Creating TNT and lava traps.</li>

                  <li>Setting fires around another player.</li>

                  <li>Killing another player's pets or livestock</li>

                  <li>Leaving doors open at night.</li>

                  <li>Excluding other players.</li>

                  <li>Staying awake when everybody else is sleeping.</li>

                </ul>

              </li>

              <li>Bedtime is more important than the game.  The server shuts
down at 8pm each night, and restarts at 8am the following morning.  Each parent
can set whatever limits they see fit, but our kids get 30 minutes per day during
the week, and an hour on the weekend.</li>

            </ul>

          </div> <!-- .content-block -->

          <h1>Some tips for players</h1>

          <div class="content-block">

            <p>When you begin, you can't break blocks.  You should move away
from that area before building your first house.</p>

            <p>Ender chests are a way to save your special items where no other
player can access your stuff.  We'll keep one near the place where players enter
the game.</p>

            <p>The server shuts down at bedtime, and everything is saved
automatically.  When you reconnect you'll be right where you stopped.</p>

            <p>All players must be in a bed to skip the night. If you don't have
a bed, disconnect from the game for a minute when someone says "Sleep".  When
you reconnect to the server, it will be morning.</p>

            <p>If you join the game and it's the middle of the night, don't
panic. Disconnect, wait 7 minutes, and connect again and it'll be daytime.</p>

          </div> <!-- .content-block -->

          <h1>Some tips for parents</h1>

          <div class="content-block">

            <p>It's easy for kids to get into all-Minecraft, all-the-time mode.
If you want a primer on it, ask the admin.</p>

            <p>A lot of kids use Minecraft like virtual Legos. This is Creative
mode. At some point, they may want to switch to Survival mode.  We run both
types of games, and joining another game type means disconnecting from the
current game and joining another.  Unlike in single-player, you can't change the
game type back and forth in the settings.</p>

            <p>Sometimes kids really get upset over another player's actions,
even to the point of tears. Often the other player thinks they're only playing.
If this happens, don't wait to say something to the admin.</p>

            <p>The server is backed up periodically.  If something really bad
happens, like a painstakingly created construction is destroyed by another
player, it is possible to roll back to yesterday's version of the game. This
means everything that was done that day is lost, but sometimes that's needed for
things to be made right.</p>

            <p>If you have any questions or concerns at all, ask.</p>
